Strong Growth Across Key Drivers This impressive growth has been driven by exceptional contributions across key product segments, supported notably by Ram Sirohi and Vinoy, whose efforts in executing a 360-degree campaign and ensuring timely support through supply chain excellence were critical. DEKALB 9178 achieved over 350 MT DEKALB 9133 exceeded 100 MT DEKALB 9233 contributed an additional 200 MT These strong product performances have been central to the squad’s success, reflecting both demand and effective execution. Proactive Engagement & Community Outreach Beyond numbers, the squad’s success is deeply rooted in a vibrant and active engagement strategy with farmers, retailers, and dealers: Post-sales activities covering 100,000 farmers enhanced product adoption and customer satisfaction. Festive and culturally significant events like Sankranti Celebration reached over 6,000 farmers, strengthening community connection. Ugadi festival campaign successfully engaged 10,000 farmers and 800 retailers with posters and celebrations. Ahead of the season, two rounds of crash campaigns mobilized cross-functional teams to reach 200,000 farmers, ensuring preparedness and market penetration. Strategic Planning for Sustained Success The squad implemented highly visible and customized initiatives to boost presence and availability: Over 300 dealers received customized boards to enhance brand visibility. 20+ ground activation vehicles reached 30,000 farmers once the season began. Successful launch of ABS and a new hybrid introduction was conducted with 600 retailers. Strategic pre-positioning of 5359 MT stock ensured product availability aligned with demand spikes. Meticulous micro-level planning took place at the farmer, village, and retailer levels to maximize efficiency. The Central Karnataka Squad’s achievement of crossing the 5000 MT mark in DEKALB is a testament to teamwork, planning, and sustained execution. With a solid foundation laid in the beginning of the year, the squad is confidently targeting 5200 MT by the close of 2025, driving continued growth and farmer support in the region. Congratulations to the Central Karnataka Squad for this remarkable milestone and their unwavering commitment to excellence!

        "text": "Mail Microsoft Teams Zurück ARTIKEL MIT TEAMS TEILEN Personen hinzufügen TEILEN In Yammer teilen Leading with Purpose: Agra Squad’s Spring Corn Success North Unit 2’s Agra Squad has redefined what success looks like in Spring Corn. In a season marked by fierce competition and shifting dynamics, the squad didn’t just adapt—they owned the challenge. Fuelled by a clear vision, sharp execution, and the VACC leadership spirit, they turned strategy into momentum and momentum into results. This wasn’t just about meeting targets—it was about setting new ones. Behind the outcome lies a culture of belief, bold thinking, and relentless teamwork. The Agra Squad’s journey is a reminder to every team at Bayer: lead with purpose, and impact will follow. \"Jo dikhta hai, vahi bikta hai!\" — This age-old Hindi saying came to life this spring as the Agra Squad turned visibility into victory, rewriting the narrative for Bayer’s Spring Corn portfolio. What unfolded wasn’t just a campaign- it was a movement. A testament to what a squad can achieve when united by purpose, powered by the VACC (Visionary, Architect, Catalyst, Coach) leadership spirit, and inspired by the principle that a strong start builds the momentum for greatness. Facing the Shift: Rising to Market Challenges For the past two years, Spring Corn cultivation had gained traction, but the path ahead wasn’t smooth. Supply constraints loomed large, and generic competition intensified. With Bayer’s market share in question, Ajit Upadhyay, Commercial Champion for the squad, faced a defining moment. “How do we increase farmer reach?” “And how do we reclaim and expand our market share?” These weren’t just questions—they were rallying calls. Visionary Thinking: Creating the Blueprint for Success Guided by Unit Lead Sonpal Singh Verma, the Agra Squad adopted a Visionary approach, looking beyond the obvious and daring to reimagine what was possible. Prashant Singh, Marketing Champion, took charge of the campaign, initiating an aggressive plan to boost visibility, credibility, and farmer trust. Building on the previous year’s strong base, the squad set out to significantly elevate performance and deepen market presence—it was clear this wasn’t business as usual. This was a step from good to great. Architecting the Journey: Structured Action, Seamless Execution The squad lived the 70:20:10 learning principle—learning by doing, observing, and reflecting. A robust campaign was architected, launching in the first week of January with intensive internal training to sharpen the team’s edge. The foundation was laid in the Pre-Sales phase: 1,750 Farmer Meetings 2.5 Lakh Farmers Reached 530 Retailers Engaged 116 Meetings in a Single Day With precise targeting, Dekalb Mahotsav was celebrated from 25th Jan to 10th Feb, with 31st Jan marked as Dekalb Day—turning field visits into festivals and product knowledge into farmer empowerment. Catalyst in Action: Energy, Speed, and Influence This campaign wasn’t just about quantity—it was about quality with velocity. The Agra Squad catalyzed change by knocking on doors before the customer even realized the need. Post-sales activities kept the momentum alive: 150 Mega Field Days 105 Harvest Days 1255 Total Activities 1.5 Lakh Farmers Reached Post-Sales 640 Retailers Showcased A shining moment came from Etah territory under CCM Shivendra Singh, who orchestrated a Mega Farmer Meeting with 3,500 farmers in a single day. A true demonstration of catalytic leadership and local heroism. Coaching Culture: Building Trust, Celebrating Together From discussions before decisions to sharing every success and taking full ownership of every setback—the Agra Squad embodied the ‘Coach’ mindset. “We work as a team.” “We celebrate together.” “We grow together.” This wasn’t just said—it was practiced every day in the field. The Results: Turning Strategy into Success And the results? Nothing short of phenomenal: 50 MT of DKC9248 sold in its very first year of launch—a hybrid that’s already winning hearts for its performance and income security. 2050 MT total Spring Corn sales—surpassing the budget by 17% and growing 32% over last year. 12% market share growth—in a highly competitive and constrained environment. 2.5 lakh farmers influenced, empowered, and connected. This isn’t just a story of great numbers—it’s a story of people, passion, and possibility. Agra Squad proved what happens when clarity meets collaboration, and strategy meets execution. They weren’t waiting for success—they went out and created it. As we move forward, their journey serves as a blueprint for every squad across the country: Dare to dream big Build the systems to support it Move fast, lead from the front And always take care of your people To the Agra Squad—thank you for leading the way. You are the heartbeat of Bayer’s transformation.

In this interactive 3D world, operators and supervisors can: Interact & learn equipment operation and safety protocols through real world simulations Practice quality checks and SOPs in a controlled, risk-free environment Receive real-time feedback on their performance Be assessed digitally, creating a comprehensive training dashboard and matrix Each year, we invest over 1,000 hours in training new operators and supervisors—equipping them to make critical decisions and run processes effectively during their shifts. Yet, high attrition among contractual workers creates a constant cycle of retraining, stretching our time and resources. Traditional methods—classroom sessions, manual demonstrations, PowerPoint explanations, and paper-based assessments—are not only outdated and time-consuming but also offer little visibility into trainee progress or development needs. Operators and supervisors are the backbone of our operations—ensuring customer reliability, quality output, equipment performance, and workplace safety. But we’ve been preparing them for modern-day challenges using yesterday’s tools. It’s time for a change. The Transformation With this VR model, we move from reactive to proactive training. Every session is consistent—no matter who conducts it. Performance is tracked automatically, highlighting strengths and gaps, enabling to tailor future training and reduce errors in the process.

        "text": "Mail Microsoft Teams Zurück ARTIKEL MIT TEAMS TEILEN Personen hinzufügen TEILEN In Yammer teilen Empowering farmers through Sustainable Agriculture For many smallholder farmers in India, cultivating rice is becoming increasingly challenging, with depleting water resources, rising costs, and the growing impact of climate change adding to the strain. The Good Rice Alliance (TGRA), powered by Bayer in collaboration with its partners GenZero, Shell, and Mitsubishi Corporation, is supporting over 10,000 farmers, covering 25,000 hectares across the country to adopt climate-smart practices like Direct Seeded Rice and Alternate Wetting And Drying. As Bayer continues to lead the charge towards a climate-resilient and sustainable agriculture, it’s inspiring to see tangible progress on the ground. A recent article in Hindustan Times Co- authored by Bayer’s Suhas Joshi , head of the Good Rice alliance in   highlights the remarkable transformation happening on Indian rice fields , across many states in India — Through the (The Good Rice Alliance) program (TGRA)- powered by  Bayer, and its partners - GenZero, Shell, and The Mitsubishi corporation.  Rice farmers are focusing on advancing sustainable rice growing practices in  by adopting climate-smart techniques like Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) and Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD). These methods not only support higher farmer incomes and water conservation, but also significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This isn’t just a shift in technique, it’s a transformation in mindset. •  The Good Rice Alliance has • Supported over 10,000 smallholder farmers across more than 35,000 hectares • Achieved more than 100,000 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent emissions reductions annually • Delivered significant water savings and reduced cultivation costs for farmers This aligns closely with Bayer’s vision of “Health for all, hunger for none.” By helping farmers do more with less—less water, less emissions, less risk—we contribute to food security while protecting natural resources. 🌱 Why This Matters to Bayer The transformation happening in states like  in Telangana, Odisha, Karnatake etc. is more than a local success; it’s a microcosm of the global transformation agriculture must undergo. Global agri-food systems now emit over 16.2 billion tonnes of CO₂ equivalent, with rice farming being a major source of methane. The challenge is enormous—but so is the opportunity. At Bayer, we recognize that smallholder farmers are central to this transition. By equipping them with climate-smart tools, digital technologies, and market access, we enable them to reduce emissions while improving yields and livelihoods. 🌍 Unlocking the Potential of Carbon Markets One of the most promising developments is the growth of voluntary carbon markets, now valued at $1.7 billion in 2024* . These markets offer farmers financial incentives to adopt sustainable practices that generate verified carbon credits. Bayer is actively exploring ways to support farmers in: • Participating in international carbon markets through transparent, simplified registration systems • Leveraging digital tools for real-time farm guidance, remote sensing, and AI-powered MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) • Support the development of science by investing in scientific measurements and research in agricultural emission reductions • Aggregating efforts via grassroot partners to increase scale and impact ________________________________________ 🤝 The Road Ahead: Partnering for Scalable Impact We know that transformation requires collaboration. That’s why we are deepening partnerships with governments, NGOs, startups, and farmer groups to strengthen policy frameworks, build capacity, and ensure fair and credible participation in sustainability-linked programs. Our role as Bayer employees—whether in R&D, field operations, regulatory, or corporate—is to ensure we bring the best science, tools, and partnerships to farmers around the world. The example of TGRA  is a call to action and a proof of possibility. Let’s continue to lead with purpose, act with urgency, and build a resilient, inclusive agricultural future—together. TGRA is a blueprint for how agriculture can lead the climate charge—profitably and sustainably.

Launched in 2024, Ask Deena has quickly gained traction, reaching a significant milestone of 20,000 users. This achievement highlights the critical role of digital solutions in enhancing farmer success by delivering personalized guidance and support. In our ongoing effort to drive Direct Seeded Rice (DSR) and regenerative agriculture, the Bayer DirectAcres Venture team has been pivotal in helping smallholder paddy farmers in India, transition from traditional Transplanted Rice (TPR) to DSR, a more sustainable cultivation method. This transformation isn’t easy; it requires farmers to change not only their farming techniques but also their habits, timing, and trust in this new practice. Building a Supportive Solution To support our farmers on this journey, we developed a simple yet powerful solution: a WhatsApp-based advisory chatbot named Ask Deena, launched in 2024. This innovative tool delivers real-time, contextual, and localized guidance directly to farmers' phones. What began as a test-and-learn initiative has now become an integral part of the Direct Acres offering, complementing our tailored solutions - seed, herbicide, and mechanization solutions. Ask Deena addresses critical farmer concerns ranging from seed selection to harvest, covering all agronomy and advisory topics in between, including weed management, pest and disease control, soil nutrition, and timing of operations. It also assists with last-mile service discovery (such as DSR seed drill booking) and first-time success, all essential for building trust in DSR. Not just that, it gives real-time answers including via voice notes, offering an easy farmer-friendly experience in the local language (Hindi, English, Punjabi and Odia). Ask Deena is currently accessible to farmers from 8 states – Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Anyone who is interested to know more about Direct Seeded Rice can use this chatbot for localized advisory! Milestone Achievement We are proud to announce that this week, Ask Deena crossed a significant milestone of over 20,000 farmer users on the platform, with more than 75% of them actively engaging and a 50% weekly retention rate. Daily engagement continues to grow steadily, with farmers increasingly sending in voice queries, showcasing their comfort with digital tools when they see clear value. Key Takeaways from the 20K User Milestone 1. Digital Engagement: The success of Ask Deena illustrates the willingness of farmers to engage digitally when value is clear and accessible. The chatbot has become a crucial touchpoint for providing personalized agronomic advice, which is vital for building long-term relationships with our farming community. 2. Continuous Improvement: The data collected through Ask Deena creates a feedback loop that helps refine our products and services. As more farmers use the platform, we can better understand their needs and enhance our offerings accordingly. 3. Community Connection: The milestone reflects the collaborative efforts of cross-functional teams within Bayer. By leveraging digital tools like Ask Deena, we are creating more connected, responsive, and scalable solutions that ultimately deliver greater value to our farmers. Together, we are shaping a sustainable future for paddy cultivation, empowering farmers with the knowledge and tools they need to thrive in an ever-changing agricultural landscape.

It serves as a dynamic hub for demonstrating advanced agricultural techniques, facilitating knowledge exchange, and building a future-ready agri-ecosystem with one unified goal: to empower farmers with holistic, sustainable solutions by uniting key stakeholders on a single platform. Established during the Dry Season 2024–25 (October to April) at Dr. Gangadharrao Pathrikar College of Agriculture Pathri (Phulambri) the BLC is the result of a strong institutional collaboration between Bayer Crop Science (BCS) Market development & commercial team of Aurangabad Squad, Seminis, Yara Fertilizers, and Namrata Industries. This strategic alliance brings a one-stop solution from seed to harvest, setting a new standard in agri-ecosystem development. As we approach the harvest stage, we are collecting both qualitative and quantitative data for ROI calculations and proof of concept submissions. As agreed, we also plan to continue our differentiated BLC collaboration with this institution for the 2025 wet season (Kharif crops). Key Highlights of the Bayer Learning Center: Demonstration of 9 Strategic Crops: corn, tomato, chilli, cauliflower, watermelon, okra, bitter gourd, cucumber, and pole beans—selected for their regional relevance and potential impact.

        "text": "Mail Microsoft Teams Zurück ARTIKEL MIT TEAMS TEILEN Personen hinzufügen TEILEN In Yammer teilen Prioritizing Partners: A Customer-Centric Innovation Journey Bayer's Crop Science Division addressed GST reversals on Rebate Credit Notes issued to Distributors through a digital-first approach, upgrading systems and processes. The initiative unlocked around ₹1,115 million (€12 million) p.a. in GST credits, optimized working capital, which is delivering exceptional value for its Direct Channel Partners. The Situation In 2017, India introduced the Goods and Services Tax (GST) reform, fundamentally transforming the country’s taxation framework. Bayer CropScience swiftly adapted to this new regime for core operations like sales invoicing and returns. However, it was decided to issue Commercial Rebate CN/DN without GST due to regulatory complexities and inherent business challenges. However, this led to an unintended consequence — the accumulation of unclaimed tax credits by distributors, a pressing issue particularly in the agrochemical sector. The Challenges The journey was not without its complexities: •  Regulatory Intricacies: Achieving compliance with strict GST norms — such as pre-agreement of discounts, invoice-specific linkages, and ensuring timely ITC reversals — proved highly complex. •  Distributor Readiness: Encouraging widespread distributor adoption required persistent engagement, education, and ongoing support. •  Policy & Process Changes: Aligning Policy & process changes with Internal & External Stakeholders w.r.t. Rebate Programs & mandatory communication •  System Integration: Flawless synchronization between SAP, Kaleido, the Digital Finance App, and Cygnet required meticulous planning and execution. •  Documentation & Compliance: Managing the operational burden of distributor self-declarations and certifications (especially for high-value discounts above INR 5 lakhs) added a new dimension of oversight. The Solution Recognizing the burden this placed on its distributor network, Bayer embarked on a comprehensive, customer-first transformation to align its Policies, Systems, and Processes with GST requirements for Rebate CNs and DNs. A digital-first strategy was central to the initiative, enabled through the Bayer Digital Finance App, which offered distributors a seamless, opt-in process for GST-compliant credit notes. Key steps included: •  Cross-Functional Collaboration: An orchestrated effort across Finance, Taxation, DT&IT, GBS Automation, Legal, and Commercial teams ensured a holistic solution design. •  Clear Guideline Definition: Policies now mandate that rebate programs must be communicated upfront, CNs must reference original invoices, and credit notes must adhere to a tax invoice format. •  System Readiness: Critical updates to SAP systems (PBC/Vistex & P08), policy overhauls, and the deployment of IT enablers such as Kaleido fortified the technical backbone. •  Process Streamlining: Legal safeguards, including a binding Addendum to Distributor Agreements, were introduced. Opted-in customers are systematically tagged in SAP, and all communications are managed through digital channels. •  Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs): Comprehensive SOPs cover every aspect — from distributor opt-ins and invoice management to sale returns, ITC reversals, and rebate program governance. The solution is being piloted from April 1, 2025, with nationwide expansion planned following Phase 2 of SAP development. The Outcome The initiative will deliver substantial gains, despite the hurdles, •  Distributor Empowerment: Distributors have the flexibility to opt for GST on Rebate CNs thereby reduce their tax accumulation and improve liquidity. •  Operational Efficiency: Streamlined workflows, digital tools, and system harmonization will enhance process transparency and execution speed. •  Audit Readiness: With digital communication, automated approvals, e-invoicing capabilities & archiving facilities, Bayer is well-prepared for any future Audits •  Financial Accuracy: Automating the link between CNs/DNs with original invoices ensures accurate application of GST and enhances transparency for customers. •  Working Capital Optimization: By unlocking around ₹1,115 million (€12 million) in GST credits, Bayer has significantly optimized working capital, delivering exceptional value for its Direct Channel Partners. Bayer’s proactive and innovative approach to GST compliance for rebate transactions showcases the power of cross-functional collaboration, digital innovation, and customer-centric thinking. By resolving a critical industry-wide issue, Bayer not only strengthened its regulatory standing but also delivered significant financial and operational value to its partners.

In Punjab, over 42,000 farmers across 260+ villages and over 500,000 farmers across 2950 villages, in UP participated in 2500+ roadshows and interactive sessions. Corn is not just a staple crop; it is a key growth engine for Bayer in IBSL. The increasing demand for corn in India, driven by its versatile uses in food, feed and fuel, positions it as a strategic growth driver for the Crop Science Division in India. Today, India is witnessing a steady rise in corn demand, with the grain being increasingly consumed in processed food products and the growing poultry and livestock industries fueling demand for high-quality feed. Additionally, the push towards bioethanol blending and cleaner energy alternatives is making corn a critical feedstock for biofuel production. This multi-sectoral demand underscores the importance of corn for Bayer as a driver of long-term growth. Given all of these opportunities, the corn team, along with the Commercial Units of North 1 and 2 under the guidance of Mohan Babu, decided to capitalize on this opportunity and drive the growth of corn sales in the Spring Corn season. Out of this vision was born the idea of organizing a mega Spring Corn Festival in two key markets: Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Punjab. The Spring Corn Festival aimed to empower farmers with advanced knowledge and agronomic practices. Over the course of a month-and-a-half-long festival, team members engaged with over 500,000 farmers across 2,950 villages in UP and over 42,000 farmers across 260+ villages in Punjab. This was achieved through 2,500+ interactive knowledge-sharing sessions where farmers were provided with practical tools and agronomic advice to improve their yields and income. Furthermore, during the festival, DEKALB also launched new hybrid DEKALB9248 in the Spring Season which will help us fuel the growth in upcoming years. To ensure maximum reach and give the festival a massive scale, a collaborative effort was made. Colleagues from various functions, including MD, FS, Breeding, Marketing, and many others, volunteered their time and expertise to make the farmer engagement initiative a mega success. The festival was backed by a large-scale communications outreach in vernacular languages, ensuring that the message resonated with local farmers and communities. The workshops provided in-depth training on sustainable agricultural practices, precision farming, and soil health management, along with demonstrations of DEKALB’s Spring Hybrids, known for their adaptability, superior standability, and high starch content (80-85%), making them ideal for ethanol production. Additionally, live agronomic training offered expert insights on best practices for corn cultivation, pest management, and optimizing resource use to maximize productivity. \"The Spring Corn Festival marked a major success, with record-breaking sales and a 44% surge in revenue compared to 2024.\" Reflecting on the initiative, Mohan Babu, Commercial Lead for Crop Science Division in India, shares, “Our success is built on the spirit of collaboration and the unwavering dedication of our teams. The Spring Corn Festival was a powerful example of what we can achieve together. Corn continues to be a key strategic growth driver for IBSL, and this initiative showcased how aligned efforts across teams can drive meaningful outcomes for farmers and our business. Congratulations to everyone for delivering an outstanding result!” Jantar Pal Verma from Mau Taluka, district Etah in Uttar Pradesh shared his experience: \"Earlier, I relied on conventional methods, but these workshops opened my eyes to new ways of improving productivity. Learning about better seed choices and modern practices has given me the knowledge to make smarter decisions for my farm.\" Jagminderpal Singh from Grewal Village, Burj Hakima District, Ludhiana, shared: \"The training helped me understand new techniques that will improve my farm’s yield. Seeing these methods in action has given me the confidence to apply them on my land and better meet market demands.\" The workshops spanned multiple locations in Uttar Pradesh, including Ferozabad, Mainpuri, Etawah, Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Hathras, Etah, and Kashganj districts, while engaging over 500,000 farmers in discussions on sustainable farming, crop management, and technology-driven solutions. In Punjab, locations such as Fatehgarh Sahib, Ludhiana, Patiala, Malerkotla, Sangrur, Bathinda, Sri Muktsar Sahib, Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur, and Moga engaged over 42,000 farmers.

The Plan Aggregation Tool (PAT) is a smart system tool designed to simplify and streamline the Annual, Quarterly & Monthly Planning and Consolidation Process for the Crop Science Commercial organization in India. It is a one-stop solution for efficient and accurate planning for all the metrics: SELL-IN, SELL-OUT, OPEX & COLLECTION. The tool is a single platform for communication across functions like Sales, Business Enablement, Finance, Marketing & Product Supply. Why do we need it: The current planning process is tedious, repetitive and manual. There is no SINGULAR HUB to plan in an integrated manner. It’s a long-pending unmet need as the decade-old tool EDGE could not support with upgrades and meet our evolving needs and manual spreadsheets just frustrate the planning speed, accuracy, efficiency and execution activity. Why You'll Love It: •   Simplified & De-centralized: Automate data preloading and consolidation for a hassle-free experience. Planning is decentralised and data consolidation is centralised for a unified view across stakeholders. The tool transforms complex, manual tasks into a seamless, convenient process, ensuring Time is spent what truly matters. After all Time Saved is Time Earned. •   Time-Saving: Embrace the 70:20:10 principle – save time and boost productivity! Dynamic environments and changing needs, requires Commercial Team to be equipped with power of information and drive operational excellence. •   Scalable & Fast: No more lags, just quick updates and seamless planning. Tool is designed to grow and provide consistent and comprehensive data at your fingertips. DSO Ways of Working: We've embraced the DSO Spirit – FOR the People and BY the People. This tool was developed with intensive engagement from our team members, ensuring it meets the diverse needs of our organization. By incorporating continuous feedback and input from various units and squads, we've created a comprehensive solution that truly serves everyone. Challenges Drove Better Outcome: The journey of PAT wasn't without its challenges. •  The challenge was to assess diverse needs across India, where balancing \"More is Less\" versus \"Less is More\" was critical. The goal was to achieve simplicity and ease of use while accommodating complex information, ensuring alignment and acceptance among varied stakeholders across India's diverse landscape. •  Ensure Flexibility and Speed: Despite the integrated, comprehensive data sets and diverse planning needs, the tool needed to maintain its speed and flexibility, functioning seamlessly both online and offline. •  Revisit and Refine: There was nothing cast in stone for PAT Team members. The team challenged the boundaries and refined to get the best-in-class tool. Through collaboration, continuous improvement, and a commitment to excellence, the tool is going to be a game changer in our Ways of Working.

The event was made even more impactful with the presence of Professor Dragomir Ljubetic Meza, a globally respected viticulture expert from Chile. With a rich background as a private consultant in table grapes and stone fruits, and over two decades of experience, including past roles at Del Monte Fresh Produce, Chile and as Director of Uvanova (Chile’s table grape research commission), Prof. Dragomir brought invaluable insights to the field visits and interactions. His deep understanding of varietal innovations and vineyard management resonated strongly with local stakeholders. Over the course of five days, the event achieved widespread impact, engaging more than 1,500 farmers, 6+ farmer groups, 50+ advisors, and 25+ exporters. Field visits and technical meetings were held across key grape-growing regions in Nashik, where discussions focused on evolving trends, including the emergence of new grape varieties expected to significantly influence the industry over the next 4–5 years. These interactions brought to light the critical need for advanced agronomic support and crop protection solutions to help farmers manage these new varieties effectively. The strong involvement of MRDBS further enhanced trust and collaboration, reinforcing Bayer’s position as a partner of choice for holistic solutions in agriculture. The event reflected Bayer’s continued commitment to high-impact, year-round engagement with grape growers through a \"physital\" approach, aimed at delivering sustainable, long-term success for the farming community.

By replacing manual efforts with automation, Kaleido enhances efficiency, improves accuracy, and ensures businesses can focus on strategic growth. In today’s dynamic business world, handling complex processes manually can lead to delays and missed opportunities. Schemes, often designed to drive liquidation require meticulous planning, approvals, and constant tracking to ensure they are effective to meet business objectives. From scheme design and approval to managing communications, calculations, and reporting, businesses often face challenges that slow down operations. These tasks, currently managed in Excel, require constant attention, are prone to mistakes, and take up valuable time. For example, coordinating multiple versions and approvals in Excel can create confusion, and manually sending communication to channel partners often leads to missed updates. Moreover, handling TDS queries and accessing historic payout data from large files can be overwhelming. This is where Kaleido steps in to transform operations. Kaleido, a tool conceptualized by the Channel Engagement team developed in collaboration with GBS Team. By automating scheme design, approval workflows, and notifications, Kaleido streamlines what was once a time-consuming process. Users can now access real-time visibility of current and past schemes, ensuring that no detail is overlooked.
